# 📜 Dart Quill Delta

An unofficial Dart port of [quill-js-delta](https://github.com/quilljs/delta/), originally written in TypeScript.

This package provides a Dart implementation of the [Quill Delta](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-delta) format, which is a JSON-based data structure used to describe rich-text documents. For more details, refer to the official [Quill Delta documentation](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/).

## 📖 Background

Previously, this package was part of the [flutter_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill) package, but it has since been separated into its own package.
